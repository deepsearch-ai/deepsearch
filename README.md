# deepsearch
A simple python lib to search for relevant media from your data corpus.
1. Users can upload images, text, audios or videos to add as data to be searched
2. LLM models (customisable) help tag, describe and index the data
3. Embeddings from this are then added to a vector database (configurable)
4. Search APIs that help relevant data (across all multimedia types) from the vector database.
